          "feedback": "The training effectively covers a range of critical topics related to human trafficking, including definitions, signs, and legal regulations, which are essential for hotel employees. However, it lacks tailored content for different hotel employee positions, which is important for ensuring that all staff, from front desk to housekeeping, understand their specific roles and responsibilities in identifying and reporting trafficking. Incorporating position-specific scenarios and guidelines could enhance the training's relevance and effectiveness."

          "feedback": "The training effectively covers several key aspects of anti-human trafficking, particularly in defining the issue and recognizing signs of trafficking. However, it lacks survivor accounts, which could provide powerful, personal insights into the experiences of victims and enhance the emotional impact of the training. Additionally, including statistics would strengthen the training by providing concrete data that highlights the prevalence and urgency of human trafficking, making the content more compelling and informative."
