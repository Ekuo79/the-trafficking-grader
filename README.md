    *This link may be better: https://www.w3schools.com/django/django_create_virtual_environment.php#:~:text=It%20is%20suggested%20to%20have,we%20will%20call%20it%20myworld%20.*
4. Run the project with:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Note: Create a FORK of the repository, then clone your fork on your local machine - You will create pull requests with your changes as opposed to updating the repository directly unless it's a small change (i.e. implementing a large feature vs updating ReadME or adding code comments). 
This will allow others a chance to approve changes! 

Any collaborator may merge a PR afer confirming the code works.

Be sure to update your fork regularly :)
