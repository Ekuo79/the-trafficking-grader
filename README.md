## Setup

1. Ensure you have the latest version of Python 3: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Set up virtual environment: https://dev.to/kachiic/how-to-clone-a-django-project-from-github-and-run-it-locally-mac-ios-2o4k
3. Run the project with:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Note: Create a FORK of the repository, then clone your fork on your local machine - You will create pull requests with your changes as opposed to updating the repository directly unless it's a small change (i.e. implementing a large feature vs updating ReadME or adding code comments). 
This will allow others a chance to approve changes! Any collaborator may merge a PR.
Be sure to update your fork regularly :)
